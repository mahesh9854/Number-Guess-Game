## Project Overview

"Guess the Number" is a Java-based game that challenges players to guess a randomly generated number. It's a simple yet entertaining project that showcases fundamental Java programming concepts. This project was created as part of my role as a Java Developer at Oasis Infobyte.

## How it Works

1. **Random Number Generation**: The game begins by generating a random number within a specified range, typically 1 to 100.

2. **User Interaction**: Players are prompted to enter their guesses through a user-friendly dialogue box.

3. **Feedback**: The computer provides immediate feedback, indicating whether the entered number matches the generated one or if it's higher or lower.

4. **Continuous Gameplay**: The game continues, challenging players to keep guessing until they correctly identify the secret number.
